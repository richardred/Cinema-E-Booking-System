### Fall 2018 Cinema E-Booking System

The online Cinema Booking System (CBS) has one theatre and few number of employees and halls. The system
keeps information about thousands of movies, show times and registered customers.
The System is a website to provide the customers facility to book tickets for a movie online and to gather
information about the movies and theater halls. Customer needs to register at the site to book tickets to the
movie. After selecting the show, the user is presented a seating layout so that she/he can select seats of her/his
choice. The user will be directed to the age selection page, to select the age of the ticket owner. Thereafter the
user is redirected to the payment page for making a transaction. User can update his profile, take a print out of
the ticket and also view his booking history.
The system should enable the system administrator to add and update movie information, ticket prices and types,
and user information. System administrator will view real time statistics of booking, sales, running movies, and
registers users through a filtered reports facility.
Ticket prices are set according to the age category of the ticket owner. The system has three age categories: Child,
adult and senior.
